Survival Analysis with various techniques (nonparametric, parametric, semiparametric, frailty and multilevel modelling) on the factors impacting the consumption of cocaine on a sample of subjects. 
The data specifically refers to a sample of 1658 men born between 1944-54 for which we want to study the factors that lead to the use of cocaine after the 17th birthday. The following variables are available:
Fixed over time
ID = no. identifier of the individual
cokeage = age at first use of cocaine (17th birthday onwards) or censorship age
observation (max 42 years)
censor = case censored (1) or less (0) with respect to the use of cocaine
birthyr= year of birth: values 0-10, corresponding to the years 1944-1954
earlymj=early use (before age 17) of marijuana (1=yes, 0=no)
rural=residence area (1=rural, 0=urban)
time employees
mjyes= marijuana use) aged 17 and over (1=yes, 0=no)
mjage= age at marijuana use (if no use = .)
